Build only what you reference.
==============================

Treat your script loader as a resource loader.

<style scoped>
  @host {
    background-color: #84D374;
    color: #FFF;
  }
</style>

<script type="none" slide-notes>
  - Ensures only templates that have been referenced are built.
  - Only CSS that's referenced gets injected.
</script>
