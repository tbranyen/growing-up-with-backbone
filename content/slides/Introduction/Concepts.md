* Structure is important, anecdotally I've found it has helped numerous
  developers get started on a project when it's well organized.

* Modular techniques provide an easier way to think about any kind of code and
  how it's loaded.  I find they are especially suited to Web Components
  mentality.

* Web Components are "yet-another-shift" in thinking about how you build a web
  application.

* Data binding is important enough of a *thing* that the Polymer project is
  working on a "spec" called MDV.  Ractive recently got a lot of attention and
  it's perfectly suited to Backbone.
