Improving Web Application structure.
====================================

<span class="styled">
Don't worry about modules or frameworks or anything, but the browser and
JavaScript.
</span>

``` javascript
<script src="?"></script>
```

<style scoped>
  @host {
    background-color: hsl(192, 89%, 20%);
  }

  h1 {
    color: #FFF;
  }

  .styled {
    color: #FFF;
    opacity: .4;
    opacity: .4;
  }

  pre {
    min-width: 0 !important;
  }
</style>

<script type="none" slide-notes>
Was talking to Mike P. about how frameworks and modules don't have much to do
with your structure and he mentioned how something like UMD can exist is a good
example of that.

We develop in JavaScript (or CoffeeScript) and push to browsers (when talking
specifically about web apps).
