Cleaning and Linting.
=====================

Linting can be provided by your code editor and cleaning out a directory is not
a slide-worthy task.

<style scoped>
  @host {
    background-color: hsl(192, 43%, 34%);
  }
</style>

<script type="none" scoped>
- Starting a build with linted code, and a clean, reset, environment is a good
way to start.
</script>
